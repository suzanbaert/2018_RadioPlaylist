# ideas


### basic analysis

+ key artists in general
+ key artists by radio station
+ most played songs
+ prime time blocks versus others
+ which radio has most variety


### which radios are most hits/ hitlist senstive?

+ number of times played per day ("they play the same song every hour")
+ correlation of hitlists versus number of days ("it's the histlist on repeat")
+ when are hitlist-songs being played


### stats

+ group radio stations by their playlist
+ give me 5 artists you like and 5 you dislike and i'll tell you which radio
